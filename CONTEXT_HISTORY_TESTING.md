# Context History Testing Guide

## ✅ **Database Setup Complete**
The `context_history` table has been created successfully in the `certaintimaster` database.

## 🚀 **Application Status**
All servers are running:
- ✅ Backend API: http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Python Chat: http://localhost:5001  
- ✅ Frontend UI: http://localhost:8080

## 🧪 **Testing the Context History Feature**

### **Test 1: Basic Persistence**
1. Open: http://localhost:8080/1
2. Start the interview and answer 2-3 questions
3. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5)
4. ✅ **Expected Result**: All your previous answers should still be visible in the "Context History" panel on the left

### **Test 2: Project Switching**
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/1
2. Answer some questions (e.g., "My name is John", "I like pizza")
3. Switch to: http://localhost:8080/2  
4. Answer different questions (e.g., "My name is Sarah", "I like burgers")
5. Switch back to: http://localhost:8080/1
6. ✅ **Expected Result**: Your original conversation with John and pizza should be restored

### **Test 3: File Upload Persistence**
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/1
2. Upload a file during the conversation
3. Switch to another project and back
4. ✅ **Expected Result**: The uploaded file should still be visible and clickable

### **Test 4: Database Verification**
You can check the database directly to see the stored conversations:

```sql
-- View all context history
SELECT project_id, message_type, LEFT(message_text, 50) as preview, timestamp 
FROM context_history 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- View history for project 1
SELECT * FROM context_history 
WHERE project_id = '1' 
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;

-- Count messages per project
SELECT project_id, COUNT(*) as message_count 
FROM context_history 
GROUP BY project_id;
```

## 🎯 **What's Different Now**

### **Before (Old Behavior)**:
- Context history was lost when switching between projects
- Page refresh would clear all conversation history
- No persistence across browser sessions

### **After (New Behavior)**:
- ✅ Context history persists when switching between projects  
- ✅ Page refresh preserves all conversation history
- ✅ Data survives browser restarts and computer reboots
- ✅ Each project maintains its own separate conversation thread
- ✅ File uploads are fully preserved with clickable links

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Storage**:
- All messages automatically saved to `context_history` table
- Project-specific storage using `project_id` column
- File metadata stored as JSON in `files` column
- Efficient indexing for fast retrieval

### **Frontend Features**:
- Automatic loading of context history on project switch
- Real-time saving of new messages
- Optimistic UI updates for responsive experience
- Error handling for database connectivity issues

## 🌟 **Key Benefits**

1. **Seamless User Experience**: No interruption when switching between projects
2. **Data Reliability**: Database persistence ensures no data loss
3. **Performance**: Efficient queries and indexing for fast loading
4. **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple concurrent users
5. **File Support**: Complete preservation of uploaded files

## 📝 **Usage Instructions**

The context history feature works automatically - no special actions required:
- Just use the application normally
- Switch between projects by changing the URL: `/1`, `/2`, `/3`, etc.
- All your conversations will be automatically saved and restored

**Enjoy the enhanced Interview Module with persistent context history!** 🎉
