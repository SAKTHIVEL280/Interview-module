    "Business Challenges": "**Business Challenges:**\n\n* Manual access mapping process was fragmented, error-prone, and non-compliant with regulatory standards, leading to:\n+ Inconsistent user entitlements across critical applications\n+ Frequent audit findings\n+ Slow provisioning for new hires\n* Technological uncertainties:\n+ Real-time synchronization between disparate identity systems without risking latency or data integrity\n+ SAP user provisioning APIs struggled to handle concurrent updates at scale without impacting system performance or generating authorization failures\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n* 30% reduction in onboarding speed\n* 45% decrease in access errors\n* Simplified quarterly access certification reviews",
    "Technology": "* **Technology Stack:**\n+ ReactJS for the dynamic interface\n+ FastAPI (Python) for API-heavy integrations\n+ PostgreSQL for data storage\n+ Microsoft Active Directory for user authentication\n+ SAP ERP connector APIs for integration\n+ Keycloak for Identity Federation\n+ Terraform for infrastructure-as-code provisioning\n+ RabbitMQ for asynchronous permission update workflows\n* **Project Goals:**\n+ Automate access provisioning to minimize manual errors\n+ Ensure compliance with evolving security standards\n+ Simplify audits with a transparent, real-time view of role-permission relationships\n* **Key Features:**\n+ Reusable, dynamic throttling framework for API-heavy integrations\n+ Documented role-based access policy standardization patterns\n+ Sandbox-driven validation strategy for permission mappings\n* **Testing and Validation:**\n+ Prototype integration to simulate 10,000 permission changes across Active Directory and SAP\n+ Stress tests for API performance under concurrent requests\n+ Sandbox simulations for mapping consistency and rule-based assignment detection",
    "Approach": "* The AccessMatrix project employed a phased implementation approach, integrating multiple functional modules to create a dynamic interface for role-permission mapping.\n* The project utilized ReactJS for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database management system.\n* Keycloak was used for identity federation, while Terraform was employed for infrastructure-as-code provisioning.\n* RabbitMQ was used for asynchronous permission update workflows, with a custom throttling mechanism developed to dynamically adjust request bursts based on SAP response times.\n* The solution ensured high-volume data synchronization without overloading backend systems.\n* The AccessMatrix interface reduced average user onboarding time from 7 days to 2.5 days and decreased access-related incident tickets by 45%.\n* The project's technical knowledge and reusable methods include a dynamic throttling framework, documented role-based access policy standardization patterns, and a sandbox-driven validation strategy for permission mappings.\n* The solution was validated through prototype integrations, stress tests, and sandbox simulations, confirming its effectiveness.",
    "Business Impact": "* The AccessMatrix role-permission mapping interface has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the access management process, benefiting stakeholders, including the IAM team, IT administrators, and audit/compliance officers.\n* The manual process was previously fragmented, error-prone, and non-compliant with regulatory standards, but the project has addressed these issues.\n* Key benefits include:\n??? 30% reduction in onboarding speed\n??? 45% decrease in access errors\n???
