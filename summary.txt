Business Challenges:
**Business Challenges:**

* Manual access mapping process was fragmented, error-prone, and non-compliant with regulatory standards, leading to:
+ Inconsistent user entitlements across critical applications
+ Frequent audit findings
+ Slow provisioning for new hires
* Technological uncertainties:
+ Real-time synchronization between disparate identity systems without risking latency or data integrity
+ SAP user provisioning APIs struggled to handle concurrent updates at scale without impacting system performance or generating authorization failures

**Key Benefits:**

* 30% reduction in onboarding speed
* 45% decrease in access errors
* Simplified quarterly access certification reviews

Technology:
* **Technology Stack:**
+ ReactJS for the dynamic interface
+ FastAPI (Python) for API-heavy integrations
+ PostgreSQL for data storage
+ Microsoft Active Directory for user authentication
+ SAP ERP connector APIs for integration
+ Keycloak for Identity Federation
+ Terraform for infrastructure-as-code provisioning
+ RabbitMQ for asynchronous permission update workflows
* **Project Goals:**
+ Automate access provisioning to minimize manual errors
+ Ensure compliance with evolving security standards
+ Simplify audits with a transparent, real-time view of role-permission relationships
* **Key Features:**
+ Reusable, dynamic throttling framework for API-heavy integrations
+ Documented role-based access policy standardization patterns
+ Sandbox-driven validation strategy for permission mappings
* **Testing and Validation:**
+ Prototype integration to simulate 10,000 permission changes across Active Directory and SAP
+ Stress tests for API performance under concurrent requests
+ Sandbox simulations for mapping consistency and rule-based assignment detection

Approach:
* The AccessMatrix project employed a phased implementation approach, integrating multiple functional modules to create a dynamic interface for role-permission mapping.
* The project utilized ReactJS for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database management system.
* Keycloak was used for identity federation, while Terraform was employed for infrastructure-as-code provisioning.
* RabbitMQ was used for asynchronous permission update workflows, with a custom throttling mechanism developed to dynamically adjust request bursts based on SAP response times.
* The solution ensured high-volume data synchronization without overloading backend systems.
* The AccessMatrix interface reduced average user onboarding time from 7 days to 2.5 days and decreased access-related incident tickets by 45%.
* The project's technical knowledge and reusable methods include a dynamic throttling framework, documented role-based access policy standardization patterns, and a sandbox-driven validation strategy for permission mappings.
* The solution was validated through prototype integrations, stress tests, and sandbox simulations, confirming its effectiveness.

Business Impact:
* The AccessMatrix role-permission mapping interface has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the access management process, benefiting stakeholders, including the IAM team, IT administrators, and audit/compliance officers.
* The manual process was previously fragmented, error-prone, and non-compliant with regulatory standards, but the project has addressed these issues.
* Key benefits include:
??? 30% reduction in onboarding speed
??? 45% decrease in access errors
??? Simplification of quarterly access certification reviews
* The project has also led to:
??? 45% reduction in access-related incident tickets
??? Reduced onboarding time from 7 days to 2.5 days
??? Compliance with regulatory standards, passing two external security audits with zero findings
??? Reduced quarterly access reviews from 3 weeks to 5 business days
